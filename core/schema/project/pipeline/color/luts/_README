This location is for project luts, sequence looks, and shot looks files.
The default OCIO config will look for a luts and CC files in the following
locations in this order:

1 - ./{sequence}/{shot}/
2 - ./ (this directory)

project_lut_default.cube :
Usually provided by the client, this LUT is used to transform the camera raw
colrospace to rec709 display. If the the file provided by the client is not a
.cube file, the colorsapce entity on shotgun can be updated to reflect the
correct extension or you can try renaming the extension to .cube and let ocio
figure it out. The default version of this is an AlexaV3LogC to rec709 curve.

shot_look_edit.cc :
Usually provided by editorial, when placed in the corresponding shot folders
these .cc will be applied to that shot. The shot_look_edit.cc is a flat cc
that will be applied if no CC file is found in the cooresponding shot folder.

These file names can be changed in the colorspace config to account for more
customized configutations or even muliple projects luts per project and multiple
shot ccs per shot.
