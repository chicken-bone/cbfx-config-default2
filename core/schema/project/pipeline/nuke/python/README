This location is for project-specific nuke python scripts. This path will be added
to NUKE_PATH before launching nuke so you can add a menu.py and init.py file to
add per-show customizations to. Just be aware that this folder is LIVE and
anything you add to this folder will get picked up by every active nuke session
for this project.
